# scamazon

## HW12 mySQL & Node.js

For this assignment I created a mySQL database called <scamazon.js>
the database contains a table that lists:
* item_id (unique id for each product)
* product_name (Name of product)
* department_name
* price (cost to customer)

I then populated the list with some of the fake products from the TV show 'Its Always Sunny In Philidelphia' 
So, you may recognize some of these items!

Here is a short demo video showing the user going through the prompts
